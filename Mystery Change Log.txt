	Changes

0.1
Put all of the XFCE4 dependencies and Openbox into the DE file

0.2
Themed Openbox and XFCE4 to look nice and to fit together

0.3
Added keybinds to actually be able to logout and lock the screen

0.4 
Added the XFCE4 power manager and network applet

0.5
Added the whisker menu to the XFCE4 bar

0.6 
Added the MysteryDE logo to the whisker menu button



	Things that need to be added

-An automatic .deb (for debian machines) and a .sh (for everyone else) that already has the .tar.gz files in it to be unpacked so that way when the user goes to install it, it won't require an internet connection

-A logout GUI that comes up when you hit logout in the whisker menu

-A GUI settings menu that has options for all of the settings

-Some kind of a customizable thing for FEH so that way the Mystery logo can flash on bootup and the user can easily replace it with what they want
